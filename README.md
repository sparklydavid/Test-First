# Test-First
A Batch file that copy local windows spotlight imagies to a folder

Explaination:
Windows Spotlight imagies are located at

%LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets

but not all files are image.

so if the file size meet the criteria, the code will copy it then pasted in the same location where this bat file is located.

also it would convert the file to .jpg
