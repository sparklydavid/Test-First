# Test-First
A Batch file that copy local windows spotlight imagies to a folder

Explaination:

Windows Spotlight imagies are located at ðŸ‘‡

%LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets

but not all files are image, so if the file size meet the criteria, the code will copy it then pasted as .jpg under the same location where the .bat file is located.
